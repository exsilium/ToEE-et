Set your video card to a \"no scaling\" setting for video playback. This will make in-game videos play at their original resolution. Some systems experience game crashes when they try to scale ToEE's videos to fit the monitor.\u000b3. Do not use quicksaves with ToEE. They corrupt easily. Instead, use an array of at least 5 regular saves while playing ToEE, overwriting each in turn. This practice should ensure that you have a good save to go back to if one becomes corrupt.\u000b4. Do not save during combat. This also runs a greater risk of save corruption.\u000b5. Do not play in Ironman mode. Save corruption is a fact of life with ToEE, and if your Ironman save becomes corrupt, you're finished. If you want an Ironman-style game, it's best to simply play Ironman-style in a regular game.\u000b6. Do not use \"autosave on map change\" with ToEE. Using this feature will break certain scripts in ToEE. It is set to \"off\" by default in the Co8 modpack.\u000b7. Do not install the moebius2778 temple.dll independently. This file has been heavily modded since moebius2778's day at Co8, and the moebius fixes are included in the current version. If you overwrite the current version with the moebius version, you will be \"undoing\" a great many fixes. Do not install it separately.\u000b8. Do not put an NPC in the left-most position in the party queue along the bottom of the screen. This can cause a variety of problems, such as quests not updating properly or even appearing in your logbook at all.\u000b9. Do not use Scather or Fragarach in the Fire Node or the Fire Temple. You will likely experience the endless AoO loop, and you will be very sad.\u000b\u000bMany other common issues are answered in sticky threads at the Co8 site - www.co8.org.\u000b\u000bEnjoy the game!",

Civilized people call them barbarians or berserkers and suspect them of mayhem, impiety, and atrocities. These \"barbarians\" have proven their mettle and their value to those who would be their allies.\u000b\u000bCharacteristics: The barbarian is an excellent warrior. Where the ~fighter's~[TAG_FIGHTERS] skill in combat comes from training and discipline, however, the barbarian has a powerful rage. Barbarians are at home in the wild and they run at great speed.\u000b\u000bAlignment: Barbarians are never lawful. They may be honorable, but at heart they are wild. This wildness is their strength, and it could not live in a lawful soul. At best, barbarians of chaotic alignment are free and expressive. At worst, they are thoughtlessly destructive.\u000b\u000bReligion: Some barbarians distrust established religions and prefer an intuitive, natural relationship to the cosmos over formal worship. Others devote themselves to powerful deities, such as ~Kord~[TAG_KORD] (the god of strength), ~Obad-Hai~[TAG_OBAD_HAI] (the god of nature), or ~Erythnul~[TAG_ERYTHNUL] (the god of slaughter).\u000b\u000bOther Classes: As people of the wild, barbarians are most comfortable in the company of ~rangers~[TAG_RANGERS], ~druids~[TAG_DRUIDS], and ~clerics~[TAG_CLERICS] of nature deities. Many barbarians admire the talents of ~bards~[TAG_BARDS] and are enthusiastic about music. However, barbarians don't trust what they don't understand, which includes the practices of ~wizards~[TAG_WIZARDS]. They are more tolerant toward ~sorcerers~[TAG_SORCERERS], perhaps because sorcerers are so charismatic. Barbarians have little in common with the practical, deliberate approach to combat that ~monks~[TAG_MONKS] take, but these two classes are not necessarily hostile to one another. Barbarians have no special attitude toward fighters, ~paladins~[TAG_PALADINS], clerics, or ~rogues~[TAG_ROGUES].\u000b\u000bRole: A barbarian's typical primary role in a group of adventurers is as a front-line combat specialist. No other character can match a barbarian's sheer toughness. He can also serve as a good scout, thanks to his speed, skill selection, and trap sense.\u000b\u000bAbilities: ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] is important for barbarians because of its role in combat. ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] is also useful to barbarians, especially those who wear light armor. ~Wisdom~[TAG_WISDOM] is important for several of the barbarian's class skills.

Wandering across the land, gathering lore, telling stories, working magic with his music, and living on the gratitude of his audience--such is the life of a bard. When change or opportunity draws them into a conflict, bards serve as diplomats, negotiators, scouts, and spies.\u000b\u000bCharacteristics: A bard brings forth magic from his soul, not from a book. He can cast only a small number of spells, but he can do so without selecting or preparing them in advance. His magic emphasizes charms and illusions over the more dramatic evocation spells that ~wizards~[TAG_WIZARDS] and ~sorcerers~[TAG_SORCERERS] often use. In addition to spells, a bard works magic with his music and poetry. He can encourage allies, hold his audiences rapt, and counter magical effects that rely on speech or sound. Bards have some of the same skills as ~rogues~[TAG_ROGUES]. A bard listens to stories as well as telling them, of course, so he has a vast knowledge of local events and noteworthy items.\u000b\u000bAlignment: Bards are wanderers, guided by whim and intuition rather than by tradition or law. The spontaneous talent, magic, and lifestyle of the bard are incompatible with a lawful alignment.\u000b\u000bOther Classes: A bard works well with companions of other classes. He often serves as the spokesperson of the party, using his social skills for the party's benefit. In a party without a wizard or sorcerer, the bard contributes magic. In a party without a rogue, bards use their skills.\u000b\u000bRole: The bard is perhaps the ultimate generalist. In most adventuring groups, he works best in a supporting role.

Good clerics heal, protect, and avenge. Evil clerics pillage, destroy, and sabotage.\u000b\u000bCharacteristics: Clerics are masters of ~divine magic~[TAG_DIVINE_SPELLS], a form of magic that is especially good with healing.\u000b\u000bAlignment: Like the gods they serve, clerics can be of any alignment. Because people more readily worship good deities than neutral or evil ones, there are more good than evil clerics. Clerics also tend toward law instead of chaos, since lawful religions tend to be more structured and better able to recruit and train clerics than chaotic ones. Typically, a cleric is the same alignment as his or her deity, though some clerics are one step away from their respective deities in alignment.\u000b\u000bOther Classes: In an adventuring party, the cleric is everybody's friend and often the glue that holds the party together, as well as the healer who channels divine energy to keep others alive.

To a trespasser in a druid's sacred grove, and to those who feel her wrath, the distinction is overly fine.\u000b\u000bCharacteristics: Druids cast ~divine spells~[TAG_DIVINE_SPELLS] much the same way ~clerics~[TAG_CLERICS] do, though most get their spells from the power of nature rather than from deities. In addition to spells, druids gain an increasing array of magical powers, including the ability to take the shapes of animals, as they advance in level.\u000b\u000bAlignment: Druids, in keeping with nature's ultimate indifference, must maintain at least some measure of dispassion. As such, they must be neutral on at least one alignment axis (chaotic-lawful or good-evil), if not both.\u000b\u000bOther Classes: The druid shares with ~rangers~[TAG_RANGERS] and many ~barbarians~[TAG_BARBARIANS] a reverence for nature and a familiarity with natural lands. She doesn't really understand the urban mannerisms of a ~rogue~[TAG_ROGUES] and finds ~arcane magic~[TAG_ARCANE_SPELLS] disruptive. The typical druid also dislikes the ~paladin's~[TAG_PALADINS] devotion to abstract ideals instead of \"the real world\".

Others are among the worst, with no qualms about killing for private gain, or even for sport. Fighters who are not actively adventuring may be soldiers, guards, bodyguards, champions, or criminal enforcers.\u000b\u000bCharacteristics: Fighters are familiar with all the standard weapons and armors and also develop particular weapon and fighting specialties of their own.\u000b\u000bOther Classes: The fighter excels in a straight fight, but he or she relies on others for magical support, healing and scouting. On a team, it is a fighter's job to man the front lines, protect the other party members and bring the tough opponents down.\u000b\u000bRole: In most adventuring parties, the fighter serves as a melee combatant, charging into the fray while his comrades support him with spells, ranged attacks and other effects. Fighters who favor ranged combat can prove very deadly, although without other melee support they can find themselves in front-line combat more often than they might prefer.\u000b\u000bAbilities: ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] is especially important for fighters because it improves their melee ~attack~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL] and damage rolls. ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION] is important for giving fighters many ~hit points~[TAG_HIT_POINTS], which they need in their frequent battles. ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] is important for fighters who want to be good archers or who want access to certain Dexterity-oriented feats, but the heavy armor that fighters usually wear reduces the benefits of a very high Dexterity score.\u000b\u000bClass Alignment: Any\u000b\u000bHit Die: d10\u000b\u000bBase Attack and Base Save Bonuses: see ~table~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_FIGHTER]\u000b\u000bClass Skills: ~Intimidate~[TAG_INTIMIDATE]\u000b\u000bSkill Points at 1st Level: (2 + ~Int~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE] modifier) x 4\u000bSkill Points at Each Additional Level: 2 + Int modifier\u000b\u000bClass Features:\u000b[CMD_CHILDREN]",

  "TAG_ROGUES:TAG_CLASSES:::2": "Rogues have little in common with one another. Some are stealthy thieves. Others are silver-tongued tricksters. Still others are scouts, infiltrators, spies, diplomats, or thugs. What they do share is versatility, adaptability, and resourcefulness. In general, rogues are skilled at getting what others don't want them to get: entrance into a locked treasure vault, safe passage past a deadly trap, secret battle plans, a guard's trust, or some random person's pocket money\u000b\u000bCharacteristics: Rogues are highly skilled and they can concentrate on developing any of several categories of skills. A rogue knows how to hit where it hurts and she can dish out a lot of damage with a sneak attack.\u000b\u000bAlignment: Rogues follow opportunities, not ideals. Though they are more likely to be chaotic than lawful, they are a diverse bunch, so they can be of any alignment.\u000b\u000bOther Classes: Rogues excel when protected by warriors and spellcasters, but they are wary of the sometimes overbearing disposition of ~paladins~[TAG_PALADINS].\u000b\u000bRole: The rogue's role in a group can vary dramatically based on her skill selection, but most rogues share certain aspects. They aren't capable of prolonged melee combat, so they focus on opportunistic sneak attacks or ranged attacks. The rogue's stealth and trapfinding ability make her one of the best scouts in the game.\u000b\u000bAbilities: ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] provides extra protection for the lightly armored rogue. ~Intelligence~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE] and ~Wisdom~[TAG_WISDOM] are important for many of the rogue's skills.

  "TAG_SORCERERS:TAG_CLASSES:::1": "Sorcerers",
  "TAG_SORCERERS:TAG_CLASSES:::2": "Sorcerers create magic the way a poet creates poems, with inborn talent honed by practice. They have no books, no theories, no mentors--just raw power that they direct at will. Some sorcerers claim that the blood of dragons courses through their veins. This claim may be true in some cases, although many hold that the claim is either an unsubstantiated boast or envious gossip.\u000b\u000bCharacteristics: Sorcerers cast spells through innate power rather than through careful training and study. Their magic is intuitive rather than logical. They can cast spells more often than ~wizards~[TAG_WIZARDS] and have no need to select and prepare their spells ahead of time.\u000b\u000bAlignment: Sorcery favors the free, chaotic, creative spirit over the disciplined mind, so sorcerers tend slightly towards chaos over law. Otherwise, sorcerer alignment varies considerably.\u000b\u000bOther Classes: Sorcerers find that they have the most in common with members of other largely self-taught classes, such as ~druids~[TAG_DRUIDS] and ~rogues~[TAG_ROGUES]. They sometimes find themselves at odds with members of the more disciplined classes, such as ~paladins~[TAG_PALADINS] and ~monks~[TAG_MONKS]. Since they cast the same spells as wizards do but do so in a different way, they sometimes find themselves in competition with wizards.\u000b\u000bRole: A sorcerer tends to define his role based on spell selection. A sorcerer who focuses on damage-dealing spells becomes the center of the party's offensive power, while another sorcerer that relies on charms or illusions will take a quieter role. A party with a sorcerer should strongly consider a second spellcaster to make up for the sorcerer's lack of versatility. Since sorcerers rely on their charismatic presence when interacting with others, they often serve as the \"face\" for an adventuring party.\u000b\u000bAbilities: ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA] determines how powerful a spell a sorcerer can cast, how many spells he can cast per day, and how hard those spells are to resist.

  "TAG_WIZARDS:TAG_CLASSES:::2": "A few unintelligible words and fleeting gestures carry more power than a battleaxe, when they are the words and gestures of a wizard. These simple acts make magic seem easy, but they only hint at the time the wizard must spend poring over his spellbook preparing each spell for casting, and the years before that spent in apprenticeship to learn the arts of magic. For wizards, magic is not a talent but a difficult, rewarding art.\u000b\u000bCharacteristics: The wizard's strength is his spells. Everything else is secondary. He learns new spells as he explores and grows in experience.\u000b     Some wizards prefer to specialize in a certain type of magic. ~Specialization~[TAG_CHARGEN_WIZARD_SPECIALIZATION] makes a wizard more powerful in his chosen field, but it denies him access to some of the spells that lie outside that field.\u000b     Like a ~sorcerer~[TAG_SORCERERS], a wizard can call a familiar--a small, magical animal companion that serves him.\u000b\u000bAlignment: Overall, wizards show a slight tendency toward law over chaos because the study of magic rewards those who are disciplined. Illusionists and transmuters, however, are masters of deception and change, respectively. They favor chaos over law.\u000b\u000bOther Classes: Wizards prefer to work with members of other classes. They love to cast their spells from behind strong ~fighters~[TAG_FIGHTERS], to \"magic up\" ~rogues~[TAG_ROGUES] and send them out to scout, and to rely on the divine healing of ~clerics~[TAG_CLERICS]. They may find members of certain classes (such as sorcerers, rogues, and ~bards~[TAG_BARDS]) to be not quite serious enough, but they're not judgmental.\u000b\u000bRole: The wizard's role depends somewhat on his spell selection, but most wizards share certain similarities in function. They are among the most offensively minded of the spellcasting classes, with a broad range of options available for neutralizing enemies.\u000b\u000bAbilities: ~Intelligence~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE] determines how powerful a spell a wizard can cast, how many spells he can cast per day, and how hard those spells are to resist. A high ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] score is helpful for a wizard, who typically wears little or no armor, because it provides him with a bonus to ~Armor Class~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS].

Illusions come in the following five types:\u000b\u000bFigments: These spells create a false sensation, one that is the same regardless of who experiences it.  Figments are unable to make something seem to be something else.  For example, a figment spell with audible effects cannot duplicate intelligible speech unless the spell specifically says it can.  Figments cannot produce real effects, and therefore, are useless for directly attacking foes.\u000b\u000bGlamer: A glamer spell changes a subject's sensory qualities, making it look, feel, taste, smell, or sound like something else, or even seem to disappear.\u000b\u000bPattern: This creates an image that others can see and also affects the minds of those who see it or are caught in it.\u000b\u000bPhantasm: Creates a mental image that usually only the caster and the subjects of the spell can perceive.  This image is totally within the minds of the subjects and is a personalized mental impression.  Third parties don't notice the phantasm.\u000b\u000bShadow: Creates something that is partially real.  The caster weaves it from extradimensional energies.  Such illusions can have real effects.  If a creature takes damage from a shadow illusion, that damage is real.\u000b\u000bSaving Throws and Illusions (Disbelief): Creatures encountering an illusion effect usually do not receive ~saving throws~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] to recognize it as illusory until they study it carefully or interact with it in some fashion.

You can use Dispel Magic to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magical item, to end ongoing spells (or at least their affects) within an area, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by Dispel Magic. Dispel Magic can dispel (but not counter) the ongoing effects of supernatural abilities as well as spells , and it affects spell-like effects just as it does spells.\u000b\u000b Note: The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the Dispel Magic can take effect. Thus, you can't use Dispel Magic to repair fire damage caused by a ~Fireball~[TAG_SPELLS_FIREBALL] or to turn a petrified character back to flesh. In these cases, the magic has departed, leaving only burned flesh or perfectly normal stone in it's wake.\u000b\u000b You choose to use Dispel Magic in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a ~counterspell~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_READY_COUNTERSPELL]\u000b\u000b  Targeted Dispel:  One object, creature, or spell is the target of the Dispel Magic spell. You can make a dispel check (1d20 + your ~caster level~[TAG_CASTER_LEVEL], maximum +10) against the spell or against the each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell's caster level.\u000b     If you target an object or creature that is under the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by Monster Summoning), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.\u000b     You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.\u000b\u000b  Area Dispel:  When Dispel Magic is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 30-ft. radius. For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the last cast spell back to the first cast spell until you dispel one spell (which discharges the Dispel Magic spell so far as that target is concerned). The creature's magic items are not affected.\u000b     For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the Dispel Magic spell, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.\u000b     If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by Monster Summoning) is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it from whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object.\u000b\u000b  Counterspell:  When Dispel Magic is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, Dispel Magic may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.",

All creatures within the area gain the effects of a ~Protection from Evil~[TAG_SPELLS_PROTECTION_FROM_EVIL], and no nongood summoned or conjured creatures can enter the area either.

In this case, the spell binds a nongood called creature and causes the creature to become immobile, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the Magic Circle. In the game, casting the spell against a hostile creature results in the circle being considered inward. Likewise, in ToEE, the creature cannot cross the circle's boundaries unless it succeeds at a spell resistance check, at which point it is allowed to move. If the Magic Circle is cast against a friendly creature, the spell/circle is defined as inward.\u000b     The creature trapped within the circle can do nothing that directly or indirectly disturbs the circle, but other creatures can.

Composite longbows are made from two or more layers of horn, wood, or bone.  All composite bows are made with a particular ~strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] rating (that is, each requires a minimum Strength modifier to use with proficiency).  If your Strength bonus is less than the strength rating of the composite bow, you can't effectively use it, so you take a -2 penalty on attacks with it.  The default composite longbow requires a Strength modifier of +0 or higher to use with proficiency.  A composite longbow can be made with a high strength rating (representing an especially heavy pull) to take advantage of an above-average Strength score; this feature allows you to add your Strength bonus to damage, up to the maximum bonus indicated for the bow.  Each point of Strength bonus granted by the bow adds 100 gp to its cost.  For instance, a composite longbow (+1 Str bonus) costs 200 gp, while a composite longbow (+4 Str bonus) costs 500 gp.\u000b\u000bFor example, Tordek has a +2 Strength bonus.  With a regular composite longbow, he gets no modifier on damage rolls.  For 200 gp, he can buy a composite longbow (+1 Str bonus), which lets him add +1 to his damage rolls.  For 300 gp, he can buy one that lets him add his entire +2 Str bonus.  Even if he paid 400 gp for a composite longbow (+3 Str bonus), he would still get only a +2 bonus on damage rolls and takes a -2 penalty on attacks with it because his Strength is insufficient to use the weapon to best advantage.  The bow can't grant him a higher bonus than he already has.\u000b\u000bFor purposes of weapon proficiency and similar feats, a composite longbow is treated as if it were a longbow.
